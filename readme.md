# todo

- implement issue resolvers for validations:
-- ref
-- intrinsic function evaluations
-- depends on

- intrinsic function validation:
-- resolvable error functions should return an array of errors, not a bool. could be sub-errors that the calling function wouldn't know about - e.g. missing ref
-- only allowed functions in functions
-- conditional required properties

- implement validations:
-- resource limits
